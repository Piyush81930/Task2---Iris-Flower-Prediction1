# Task2---Iris-Flower-Prediction1
## Overview
This project uses the Iris dataset to classify iris flowers into three species (**Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**) based on their petal and sepal dimensions. The Iris dataset is a popular beginner's dataset for classification tasks in machine learning.

## Files
- **`iris.csv`**: The dataset containing features of the iris flowers and their corresponding species labels.
- **`task2.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook with data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Open the `task2.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and run all cells.

## Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and explore the dataset (no missing values in Iris dataset).
2. **Model Building**: Train classifiers like Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Decision Trees.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate models using accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to classify iris species using simple machine learning models and achieve high accuracy.
